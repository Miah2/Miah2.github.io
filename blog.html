          <h1>A New Home in Ecuador</h1>
          <p>Have you ever wondered what it’s like to volunteer in an orphanage? Ashley, one of our most recent volunteers, tells about her experience volunteering with OSSO in Ecuador! Check out her story below</p>

          <p class="indicate" >Please note - children’s faces are not shown to protect their privacy according to Ecuadorian law.</p>
          <p>“A little over a year ago I had seen a billboard in Rexburg, Idaho that said, ‘OSSO’. I had remembered hearing stories that my aunt told me about her experiences during her college years when she went down to Ecuador for a few months and helped children in orphanages. I never thought that it could be me doing those same things for children in a third-world country. </p>
          <img src="./img/3.png">
          <p>During Christmas break I was determined to complete the application process for OSSO and had shared a quick video with friends about what I wanted to do in the spring. One of my roommates immediately texted me back and said, “Where do I sign up?” I was thrilled to hear that she wasn’t even questioning the idea of it and she was willing to go.  About two weeks after that text was sent, both my friend and I had sent in our applications and we were accepted!! It was easily the best decision I have ever made!</p>
          <img src="./img/4.jfif">
          <p>Arriving in Ecuador on April 26th was a lot to take in. My friend and I had been traveling for about 48 hours and were so exhausted when we arrived. During my first day on shift I remember very distinctly that the kids LOVED me. They didn’t know who I was, but they were glad I was there with them, experiencing what they do every single day. At first I was overwhelmed when 12 little kids came running and they all wanted to squeeze my leg, but then I was calm when I realized all they wanted was a new friend. The best decision I ever made was leaving my home and joining a new one here in Cuenca, Ecuador.</p>
          <img src="./img/5.jfif">
          <p>I’m going to miss the gentle but joyful hugs from the kids, and the way they pronounce my name with their cute Ecuadorian accents. I’ll never forget the big brown eyes that stare up into mine as they ask for “twinkle twinkle” a million times each night. They have made my life so much better in every single way. Moments like these are some that I’ll remember forever.”</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ashley, for your wonderful service and for sharing your story with us!</p>

            <h1>7 Things You Should Know About Volunteering with OSSO</h1>
            <img src="./img/kids.jpeg">

            <ol>
              <li>"You’ll never forget this experience. I’m going on 12 years since I volunteered in Ecuador and I STILL think of those kids, pray for them, relive my memories, and count the whole thing as a huge life-altering blessing." Although you may feel 'done' when you get home, we have many options for alumni to continue supporting the children that they love. You can become an orphan advocate, a sponsor, volunteer again at a discounted price or help us spread the word to family and friends. You can continue to help those orphans even years later! </li>
              <li>"It’s hard work. But anything that is worth it, will be. To change a life (yours or the children’s) takes effort. But, to make a difference in this world pays off ten fold and is priceless to oneself."</li>
              <li>"It’s a blast! The getaways are awesome. The country is BEAUTIFUL. The people are amazing and intriguing. And the food is delicious." We offer many different field trips and excursions for our volunteers in between shifts or on their days off. </li>
              <li>"You will wonder how you can leave and really go back to “normal” life. It’s a trip."</li>
              <li>"It’s worth every penny. And don’t be afraid to use the fundraiser ideas on the website." Our prices may seem high to some, but we are paying for your room and board, field trips, transportation, your OSSO sweatshirt and a donation that goes directly to the orphans. We have LOTS of ideas on fundraisers and those that choose to do them, are very successful!</li>
              <li>"Your eyes will be widened and your heart is going to grow in ways you didn’t expect."</li>
              <li>"Those very real kids need you."</li>
            </ol>
