            <h1>HOW WE BEGAN</h1>
            <h2>How our founder was inspired to start a charity for children</h2>
            <p>Miracle Foundation was born on Mother’s Day 2000. Our founder Caroline Boudreaux set off on a trip around the world and found herself at an Indian orphanage in a remote village in Odisha. She was haunted by the conditions in which the orphaned children lived, but captivated by their strength, beauty and untapped potential.</p>
